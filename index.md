## The internet: a "nuts and bolts" view

Billions of connected computing devices
* **hosts** = end systems
* running network apps at internet's "edge" 

Packet switches: forward packets (chunks of data) (moves packets)
* routers, switches

Communication links
* fiber, copper, radio, satellite

Internet standards (who define the protocols)
* RFC: Request for Comments
* IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force

## The Internet: a "services" view

Infrastructure that provides services to applications:
* Web, streaming video, email, games, e-commerce ...
  
Provides programming interface to distributed applications:
* *hooks* allowing sending/receiving apps to *connect* to, use the internet transport service
